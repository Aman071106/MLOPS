We also learnt postgresql here.

nd three tools:
1. Grafana
2. DbBeaver
3. aws rds for postgresql


key learning:
similar methods can  be adapted for multiple cloud services.
and we try to use any remote services by python and other libraries. so that we can code!!


Some services require ipv4 connectons for eg grafana so if ipv6 don't work or you face acess denied  several times then try ipv4 or session pooler.
